## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

### The Problem
Your friend said: **"Email/Calendar agents = hello world"**

He's 100% right. Gmail has Smart Compose. Google Calendar has "Find a Time". These are $0 value.

### The Solution: AI-EOS (AI-Powered Entrepreneurial Operating System)

**3 Core Components**:

1. **Multi-Agent Debate System** (Strategic Decisions)
   - 4 specialized agents (Analyst, Strategist, Critic, Arbiter)
   - Centralized validation (prevents 17x error amplification)
   - Confidence calibration (ConfMAD protocol)
   - Cost: $0.10-0.15 per query
   - Value: $500-2000 per consultation

2. **Research Engine** (Market Intelligence)
   - SEO Agent (Persian keyword research)
   - Market Agent (TAM/SAM/SOM analysis)
   - Financial Agent (ROI, break-even)
   - Competitor Agent (SWOT, positioning)
   - Cost: $0.20-0.30 per research
   - Value: $1000-3000 per report

3. **Growth Engine** (UNIQUE ADVANTAGE)
   - SEO Optimization (traditional search)
   - AEO (Answer Engine Optimization for ChatGPT/Gemini)
   - GEO (Generative Engine Optimization for brand authority)
   - Cost: $0.15-0.25 per strategy
   - Value: $2000-5000 per campaign

### Vertical SaaS Template: HiPet
Pre-configured for pet education in Tehran:
- 15K monthly searches for "آموزش سگ"
- 0 direct competitors
- Break-even at 300 customers @ 200K IRR/month
- Complete 4-week launch plan
